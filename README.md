## flex-fixture
Oscilloscope fixture to ease in simple probing without causing undue mess on the workspace. It allows me to more quickly switch between projects and to clean up after by moving the probe boom out of the way. In addition each probe can be plugged directly into Saleae Pro 8 for logic analysis.
